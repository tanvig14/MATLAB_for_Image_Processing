# Image Processing Activites Using MATLAB
This is a collection of MATLAB codes for image processing activities, ranging from simple things like creating geometric shpaes to implmenting image transformations and filters.

PLEASE NOTE THAT I HAVE NOT UPLOADED THE IMAGES I HAVE USED IN THE CODE SO IT WILL NOT WORK UNLESS YOU HAVE APPROPRIATE IMAGES IN THE SAME DIRECTORY/ANOTHER DIRECTORY WHOSE PATH YOU HAVE SPECIFIED. YOU CAN CHANGE THE NAMES OF IMGS IN THE CODE TO MATCH THE ONES YOU ARE USING.

Some of the things covered in the codes are:
1. Median pass filter to remove salt and pepper noise
2. Sobel filter
3. Prewitts filter
4. Roberts filter
5. Histogram equalization
6. Log and inverse log transforms
7. Flipping images, varying brightness, complementing images
8. Circle, square, traingle shape creation
