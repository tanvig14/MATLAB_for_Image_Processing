# Image Processing Activites Using MATLAB
This is a collection of MATLAB codes for image processing activities, ranging from simple things like creating geometric shpaes to implmenting image transformations and filters.

Some of the things covered in the codes are:
1. Median pass filter to remove salt and pepper noise
2. Sobel filter
3. Prewitts filter
4. Roberts filter
5. Histogram equalization
6. Log and inverse log transforms
7. Flipping images, varying brightness, complementing images
8. Circle, square, traingle shape creation
